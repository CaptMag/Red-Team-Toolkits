# Red-Team-Toolkit
This Repository is designed to understand, create and develop a wide variety of Red Team Tools

Currently a long-term project that will host over 20 tools once completed

## topic currently in testing : Networking

Currently focusing on Subdomain Enumeration + DNS Resolver

### Current Standings

Subdomain can efficiently scan a list of the 10 more popular subdomains for any site  
Testing has started for intializing wordlists as well as using `argparse` to create a better CLI tool  
`Main.py` has also been created  
Currently the wordlists are planned to be imported into the main script (to replace the word list)  
Once done, it will automatically filter out existing and non existing subdomains, and save them to a new txt file  
Currently there should be a way to do either a wordlist or use an API
